# PartyHall

PartyHall is the appliance software, that does the bulk of the features.

## Getting Started

PartyHall is available through an ansible playbook to be run on a stock debian setup.

To get started, you should visit our [documentation](https://partyhall.github.io/).

Note that the whole software has been rewritten in v0.8 and is no longer compatible at all with previous versions.
