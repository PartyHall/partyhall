/**
	Summary of routes and permissions

	Definitions:
		- authenticated: Logged in anonymously (temp user) or as a real user
		- appliance: Only callable from localhost (the appliance itself)
		- onboarded: The admin has completed the initial setup process
		- hasEvent: An event was created and is currently selected

		Note: The appliance frontend has the USER, ADMIN, APPLIANCE roles

	@TODO
	Nouvelle rÃ¨gle:
	    - Onboarded no longer exists as we have onboarding for multiple stuff
		- We should re-check to be sure that EVENT IS LOADED before most of the routes
