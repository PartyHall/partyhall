# Version 1
- [x] Simple partyhall that replicate what we had previously in a better way (Fullscreen, no lag, ...)
- [x] Events loaded from a DB
- [x] Set the system time so that we have accurate timestamps for pictures
- [x] Ability to dump all picture for a given event, plus generating a small recap video (unattended)
- [] Harware flash

# Version 2
- [] Adding the quiz feature, customizable if possible

# Version 3
- [] Remote sync to a server when connected to the internet so that the pictures are automatically shared as soon as internet is available

# TO FIX
- Weird appstate not sync-ing correctly (known issue)
- Creating an event still uses the id preventing creation / Updating a wrong event
- Failing to create an event spits out "[Object object]"
- Failing to create / edit an event returns to the main screen instead of staying on the current screen, loosing progress
- Shutting down with the buttons says "[MANUAL REBOOT REQUIRED] Failed to shutdown: exit status 1"
